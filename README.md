# MTAudotDraw

MTAudotDraw is a powerful PowerShell-based tool designed to automate the creation of detailed network diagrams by parsing configuration files from various network devices. It intelligently processes device configs, discovers network topology using protocols like CDP and LLDP, and generates professional-grade diagrams in the **.drawio (diagrams.net)** format.


-----

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **Automated Diagram Generation**: Automatically creates multi-page `.drawio` files from your device configuration backups.
  * **Multi-Vendor Support**: Parses configurations from a variety of vendors.
  * **Multiple Diagram Types**: Generates several types of diagrams to visualize different aspects of your network:
      * Physical L2 Topology (from CDP/LLDP)
      * Logical L3 Topology (SVIs, Routed Ports)
      * Focused Routed Link and High-Level Routes-Only views
      * Individual diagrams for each device's configuration.
  * **Data Export**: Exports discovered network data into structured `CSV` and `JSON` formats for further analysis.
  * **Highly Configurable**: Uses simple toggles in the `configurationVariables.ps1` file to control which diagrams are generated and what information is included.
  * **Intelligent Neighbor Discovery**: Discovers and links devices via CDP, LLDP, and ARP data, providing a more complete picture of your network.

## ‚úÖ Use Cases

This tool is incredibly useful for a variety of tasks:

  * **Network Audits & Discovery**: Quickly get a visual inventory of a new or undocumented network.
  * **Documentation**: Create a solid baseline for your network documentation with minimal effort.
  * **Change Validation**: Generate "before" and "after" diagrams to visually confirm the impact of network changes.
  * **Operational Insight**: Gain a better general understanding of network topology and routing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script operates in a series of logical steps:

0.  **Configuration data collection**: **This is not done by MTAUTODRAW** You collect all of your configuration data from your switches, routers, firewalls. 
1.  **File Discovery**: It scans the specified input directory for configuration files, identifying unique devices based on a `hostname.show version.txt` file.
2.  **Parsing with TextFSM**: It leverages **Python** and the **TextFSM** library to parse the raw text from configuration files (`show run`, `show ip interface`, etc.) into structured data. A cache of parsed data is created in a `.json` subfolder to speed up subsequent runs.
3.  **Building the Data Model**: The script constructs a rich PowerShell object model of the network, creating objects for each device, interface, VLAN, and route. It links these objects together to build a comprehensive map of the network topology.
4.  **Generating Draw.io XML**: Based on the data model and user configuration, the script programmatically generates the raw XML required to build a `.drawio` file, defining every shape, connector, and style.
5.  **Saving Output**: The final `.drawio` file, along with any exported data and a log file, is saved to the specified output directory.

## üñ•Ô∏è Supported Platforms

MTAudotDraw has explicit support for parsing configurations from the following platforms:

  * **Cisco Systems**
      * Cisco NX-OS (Nexus)
      * Cisco IOS and IOS-XE
      * Cisco ASA
  * **Check Point**
      * Check Point Gaia
  * **Juniper Networks**
      * Junos (in XML format)

> **Note:** Cisco IOS-XR may work if its command output format is similar to Cisco IOS, but it has not been formally tested.

## üîß Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

1.  **PowerShell**: Version 7 or later.
2.  **Python**: Python 3.x must be installed.
3.  **Python `textfsm` Library**: This is a critical dependency. Install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install textfsm
    ```

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1\. Project File Structure

Place all the script files (`.ps1`, `.py`) and the `Templates` directory together. The script relies on this structure to find its modules and templates.

### 2\. Prepare Configuration Files

**The script does not collect data itself.** You must run the required commands on your devices and save the complete, raw output to individual text files.

#### Required Commands

  * **Cisco IOS / IOS-XE / NX-OS:**

      * `show version` **(Required)**
      * `show run` **(Required)**
      * `show interface` or `show ip interface brief`
      * `show interface status`
      * `show cdp neighbors detail`
      * `show lldp neighbors detail`
      * `show spanning-tree`
      * `show mac address-table`
      * `show ip arp`
      * `show ip route`
      * `show ip route vrf *` (see file naming note below)

  * **Cisco ASA:**

      * `show version`
      * `show run` (or `show config`)
      * `show route`
      * `show interface`

  * **Check Point Gaia:**

      * `show version`
      * `show configuration` (or `show config`)
      * `show route all`
      * `show interfaces all`

  * **Juniper Junos (XML format is required):**

      * `show configuration | display xml`
      * `show version | display xml`
      * `show interfaces detail | display xml`
      * `show lldp neighbors | display xml`
      * `show route all | display xml`
      * `show spanning-tree bridge | display xml`
      * `show spanning-tree interface | display xml`

#### File Naming Convention

This is the most important step. All files must follow the format: **`Identifier.Command-Name.txt`**

  * The `Identifier` is a unique name or IP for a device and must be consistent for all files from that device.
  * The `Command-Name` is the command that was run.

**Examples:**

```
# For a switch named "core-switch-01"
core-switch-01.show version.txt
core-switch-01.show run.txt
core-switch-01.show cdp neighbors detail.txt

# For a router identified by IP
10.1.1.254.show version.txt
10.1.1.254.show ip route.txt
```

> **Special Case:** Since `*` is not a valid character in Windows filenames, save the output of `show ip route vrf *` as:
> `Identifier.show ip route vrf star.txt`

> **File Cleanliness:** Ensure your output files contain **only** the command output. Remove any login banners, command prompts (`switch#`), or `--more--` lines, as they will cause parsing errors.

### 3\. Configure the Script (Optional)

Open `configurationVariables.ps1` in a text editor to customize the script's behavior. You can enable or disable diagrams, exclude certain devices like phones, and toggle data exports.

### 4\. Run the Script

Open a PowerShell terminal, navigate to the script's folder, and run it with the following parameters:

```powershell
.\MTAudotDraw.ps1 -GDirectory "C:\path\to\configs" -GOutPutDirectory "C:\path\to\output" -GPathToScript "C:\mtautodraw\"
```

  * **`-GDirectory`**: The full path to the folder containing your collected `.txt` files.
  * **`-GOutPutDirectory`**: The folder where the `.drawio` files and other outputs will be saved.
  * **`-GPathToScript`**: (Optional) The path to the script folder. Defaults to the current directory.

## üîí Outbound Network Connections
üîí Outbound Network Connections
For security and operational transparency, it's important to know what network connections a script makes. MTAudotDraw is designed to work primarily on local files and does not require an active internet connection to perform its main functions, provided one file is present.

MAC Address to Vendor Mapping
* **`Purpose:`** To provide more useful information in diagrams and data exports, the script maps MAC addresses to their respective hardware vendors (e.g., Cisco, Juniper, Dell). To do this, it needs a list of Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs).
* **` Trigger:`** This connection is only attempted if the file MacAddressToVendorsMapping.csv is not present in the script's root directory.
* **` Process:`** On its first run (or if the file is deleted), the script will attempt to download the OUI list from devtools360.com. Once downloaded, it saves the data locally as MacAddressToVendorsMapping.csv.


-----
## üñºÔ∏è Output

The script will generate the following files in your output directory:

  * **`MTAudotDraw-MultiDevice-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.drawio`**: The main diagram file with multi-device physical and logical views.
  * **`MTAudotDraw-Singles-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.drawio`**: A diagram where each page is dedicated to a single device's L3 layout.
  * **`LogYYYYMMDDHHMMSS.txt`**: A transcript of the script's execution, useful for debugging.
  * **(If `$GExportData` is `$true`)**: `vlans.csv`, `cidr.csv`, `CDPNeighbors.csv`, `LLDPNeighbors.csv`, and `Objects.json`.

-----

## üí° Troubleshooting & Limitations

#### Common Issues

  * **TextFSM Errors**: If the log shows errors related to TextFSM, it is almost always because of extra text in your output files (banners, prompts, etc.). Ensure the files are clean.
  * **"File doesn't exist" or "No show version files found"**: This error means there is a problem with your file naming. Double-check that every device has a `Identifier.show version.txt` file and that the identifier is consistent.

#### Known Limitations

  * **"The script output a lot of errors at the moment. Most of these can be ignored. "**
  * The script can be slow when processing a large number of devices.
  * Duplicate hostnames are not supported and will cause the script to stop with an error.
  * Junos LLDP neighbor matching may rely on interface descriptions, which could be inaccurate if not standardized.
  * Parsing `show ip arp` from devices with VRFs is not fully implemented.

-----

## üëç Best Practices

  * **File Encoding**: The script attempts to clean files, but starting with **acsi** encoding is recommended.
  * **Break Up the Work**: For large networks, process devices in logical groups (e.g., by building or function) to keep diagrams clean. A diagram with more than 25-30 devices can become very cluttered.
